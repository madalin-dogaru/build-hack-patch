# build-hack-patch

Hacking means to trully understand the target before you attempt to hack it, but also to be able to adapt your attack if its not working one month later. 

I will start with some simple exercises, each focused on a specific vulnerability. Once all vulnerabilities are covered, I will create more complicated exercises and so on. 

Each exercise will have the following structure: 
1. Build a vulnerable application. 
2. Exploit the application.
3. Patch the application so its not vulnerable anymore.
